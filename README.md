## Hi there 👋

I love solving problems and making machines talk to each other.
I am a self-taught software engineer with a background in business and airline software development.

🌱 I've been coding in Python primarily since 2022.
🖥️ Using neovim on a Thinkpad running Linux, one Arch install away from filling all stereotypes.
