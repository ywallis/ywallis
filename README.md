## Hi there 👋

I love solving problems and making machines talk to each other.
I am a self-taught software engineer with a background in business and airline software development.

🔭 Nerding out since the 90s

🌱 Mainly a Python dev, I know my way around Go and Rust too.

🖥️ Using neovim on a Thinkpad running Linux, one Arch install away from filling all stereotypes.
